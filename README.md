## Introduction

Computer System:

- Hardware: Host and peripherals
- Software: System software and application software

[Von Neumann Architecture]() 

### Development of Digital Computers

> **Turing Machine**

1. 1946 ~ 1957: Vacuum tubes, **machine language** programming, no operating system
2. 1958 ~ 1964: Transistors, single-channel batch processing systems
3. 1965 ~ 1971: Integrated circuits, multi-channel batch processing systems and time-sharing systems
4. 1972 ~ : Very Large Scale Integration

> Moore's Law: The number of transistors that can be accommodated on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years

## Hardware Structure of Computer Systems

### CPU

#### Arithmetic Logic Unit

- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Arithmetic operations and logical operations
- Registers

#### Control Unit

Control Unit (CU): Interprets and executes instructions in memory, controls I/O devices for input and output

### Memory

#### RAM

#### External Storage

> Information in auxiliary storage must be loaded into memory before it can be accessed by the CPU

### I/O

#### Input Devices

#### Output Devices

### System Bus

#### Data Bus

#### Control Bus

#### Feedback Bus

### Graphics Card and Hard Drive

### Motherboard
